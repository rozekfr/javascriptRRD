# javascriptRRD
It is a javascript library to display RRD files which was created by Frank Wuerthwein and Igor Sfiligoi. 

I created only another version for own needs. This version edited rrdFlotMatrix module, which stacks data sources from multiple RRD files in default behavior. This version disables stacking function and draws a DSs overlaped.

This version also translates months into czech language and transforms timezone to +1.
